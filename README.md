* when working locally, using virtual environment is recommended.
- If you installed python with Anaconda, you should use conda virtual environment
(ordinary virtualenv package not recommended, because of system path issue. if you use virtualenv package and create virtual environment, because of anaconda related system paths, you cannot create independent environment. your environment will have packages same as local environment. To prevent this, create virtual environment after deleting anaconda related system paths. Using conda virtual environment automatically solves this issue.)

- If you use Window, when getting datasets by running "get_datasets.sh" file, you should use CygWin program to run sh file.
running sh file in cygwin:  >>> sh file_name.sh
